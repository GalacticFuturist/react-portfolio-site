     <p>The project was centered around inclusive design for Microsoft, mainly we were interested in creating UIs for people \r\nwho were not the typical users, as so we thought about how to do that. I decided to focuse on people who has \r\nvisual problems, either they had difficulties seeing or they were blinded.\r\n\r\nThe application that was to be designed to be more inclusive was the Dominos’s Pizza Application.</p>\r\n    <Image src={Pg1Img} fluid className=\"pg1Img\" />\r\n    </Col>\r\n    </Row>\r\n\r\n        {/* img with text */}\r\n        <Row>\r\n    <Col sm>\r\n      <h3>Samsung Voice Assistant</h3>\r\n      <p>Additionally I created the prototype with AngularJS and HTML/CSS/JS. Now that the application was able to be coded, I \r\ndecided to use a solution that would use code to implement of a solution for inclusive design. I created some custom code\r\nwith HTML and CSS that created an indivisible div, that would not be able to be seen in the visual interface.\r\n\r\nThe code would be activated using the Samsung Voice Assistant. When the voice assistant was activated, the user can \r\nactivate the invisible div, will read out the instructions of various things on the app that would be able to able to\r\nseen and read the elements.</p>\r\n    <Image src={Pg1Img} fluid className=\"pg1Img\" />\r\n    </Col>\r\n    </Row>\r\n\r\n\r\n                 {/* left text right img */}\r\n                 <Row>\r\n        <Col sm>\r\n        <h3>Personas of \r\nLimitation Spectrum</h3>\r\n        <p>I decidede to create this prototype using the \r\noriginal designs, then for the indivudals whom \r\nhad difficulties seeing I decided to increase the \r\nsizes of the elements, particuarly using more \r\nthe screen to stretch the elements for more\r\nvisibility, although this would make the \r\nappearance of the application would not \r\nbe as nice.</p>\r\n        </Col>\r\n        <Col sm>\r\n        <Image src={Pg1Img} fluid className=\"pg1Img\" />\r\n        </Col>\r\n        </Row>\r\n\r\n\r\n      {/* img without text */}\r\n        <Row>\r\n        <Col sm>\r\n        <Image src={Pg1Img} fluid className=\"pg1Img\" />\r\n        </Col>\r\n        </Row>\r\n\r\n\r\n    {/* img without text */}\r\n    <Row>\r\n        <Col sm>\r\n        <Image src={Pg1Img} fluid className=\"pg1Img\" />\r\n        </Col>\r\n        </Row>       \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        {/* img with text */}\r\n        <Row>\r\n    <Col sm>\r\n      <h3>Design Process</h3>\r\n      <p>Various steps to this application. We started with the sketches because the Microsoft Inclusive Designs had personas\r\nthat we were designing for. Mainly the Personas was for a person whom be blind or visually impaired, hard to see.\r\nAfter the sketches were done, based on the original app. We tried to come up with various solutions that would be\r\nable to solve the problems. After the designs were better designed, we did some testing, using user testing, we\r\ntested the interface with users and we were able to see what users thought about the application, and we also\r\ngot a heat map to see where the user would be clicking on the interface.</p>\r\n    <Image src={Pg1Img} fluid className=\"pg1Img\" />\r\n    </Col>\r\n    </Row>\r\n\r\n\r\n    {/* Video */}\r\n    <Row>\r\n    <Col sm>\r\n    <video autoPlay preload=\"true\" loop playsInline muted>\r\n      <source src={Vid1} type=\"video/mp4\" />\r\n    </video>\r\n      </Col>\r\n      </Row>\r\n\r\n                {/* left text right img */}\r\n                <Row>\r\n        <Col sm>\r\n        <h3>Implementation\r\nof the Interface</h3>\r\n        <p>I was not satisfied with the solution, I think\r\nI needed something more than something\r\nthat would be just some static file. I wanted\r\nan prototype that would be actually usable\r\nand then I could implement an additional\r\nsolution using code.\r\n\r\nSo I created the HTML/CSS and JS prototype,\r\nimplementing with AngularJS. After I created\r\nthat prototype, I saw that using the andriod\r\ndevice I could activate the voice assistant using\r\ncertain finger gestures.\r\n\r\nI implemented the invisible CSS div that was \r\nable to be only be seen using the voice \r\nassistant.</p>\r\n        </Col>\r\n        <Col sm>\r\n        <Image src={Pg1Img} fluid className=\"pg1Img\" />\r\n        </Col>\r\n        </Row>\r\n\r\n    {/* codepen*/}\r\n    <Row>\r\n            <Col sm>\r\n            <Codepen\r\n            hash=\"WNrqqqe\"\r\n            user=\"jaemnkm\"\r\n            defaultTab=\"result\"\r\n            preview=\"false\"\r\n        />\r\n            </Col>\r\n        </Row>\r\n\r\n         {/* left img right text */}\r\n         <Row>\r\n    <Col sm>\r\n    <Image src={Pg1Img} fluid className=\"pg1Img\" />\r\n    </Col>\r\n    <Col sm>\r\n      <h1>Completion of the\r\nPrototype</h1>\r\n      <h3>The prototype was created and I was able\r\nto present it in class, and I think based\r\non the case files it could be a possible\r\nsolution for user.</h3>\r\n    </Col>\r\n    </Row>\r\n\r\n\r\n        {/* left img right text */}\r\n        <Row>\r\n    <Col sm>\r\n    <Image src={Pg1Img} fluid className=\"pg1Img\" />\r\n    </Col>\r\n    <Col sm>\r\n      <h1>Designing and\r\nImplementing</h1>\r\n      <h3>Designing and implementing this prototype\r\ngave me a sense of happiness, knowing\r\nthat I was designing something that would\r\nhelp a Personas that needs more care\r\nthan others.
