We were working with\r\npayment companies such as PayPal, Stripe,\r\nand Merchant Accounts.\r\n\r\nMainly I was designing the product and the\r\nwebsite. Then I was developing the website\r\nwith WordPress. I created the website using\r\n1and1 for hosting services. After the WordPress\r\nwebsite was hosted, I implemented the various\r\nplugins that would be used to accept payments.</h3>\r\n    </Col>\r\n    </Row>\r\n\r\n                {/* left text right img */}\r\n                <Row>\r\n        <Col sm>\r\n        <h3>Remote Team and\r\nWarehouse Team</h3>\r\n        <p>I worked with a remote team, there was a \r\nwarehouse where the product wasa being\r\nshipped and a team that shipped out the\r\nproduct. Then there was a partner who\r\ncollaborated with our agent who relayed the\r\ninstructions to the design and development\r\nteam who was in charge of the payment\r\ninfastrcture such as a payment gateway,\r\npayment processors, and merchant accoutns.\r\n\r\nAs well as designs for the logo, product, website\r\ndesigns, and wordpress hosting and\r\nwordpress development. There were a few people\r\nbut mainly I was incharge of the website design\r\nand development.</p>\r\n        </Col>\r\n        <Col sm>\r\n        <Image src={Img05} fluid className=\"pg1Img\" />\r\n        </Col>\r\n        </Row>\r\n\r\n    {/* Video */}\r\n    <Row>\r\n    <Col sm>\r\n    <video autoPlay preload=\"true\" loop playsInline muted>\r\n      <source src={Vid1} type=\"video/mp4\" />\r\n    </video>\r\n      </Col>\r\n      </Row>\r\n\r\n    {/* img without text */}\r\n    <Row>\r\n        <Col sm>\r\n        <Image src={Img06} fluid className=\"pg1Img\" />\r\n        </Col>\r\n        </Row>\r\n\r\n        {/* img with text */}\r\n        <Row>\r\n    <Col sm>\r\n      <h3>Transaction Volumne</h3>\r\n      <p>During this process the team wasent able to figure out how to work together and the trust\r\nwas broken and the website became decreptid. We were able to process around 100K USD\r\nin transactions and a few thousand sales before the web platform was taken down.\r\n\r\nDuring this period my job was to maintain this flow of sales on the online platform.</p>\r\n    <Image src={Img07} fluid className=\"pg1Img\" />\r\n    </Col>\r\n    </Row>\r\n\r\n        {/* img with text */}\r\n        <Row>\r\n    <Col sm>\r\n      <h3>Learning Experience</h3>\r\n      <p>I became better at working remotelt with teams, and understanding that I would have to be\r\ncommunicate more efficiently. Additionally because I designed the website and then implemented\r\nthse designs with CSS, I was able to use some coding in a production environment.\r\n\r\nAdditionally being able to start the hosting of the website, the implementation of the Wordpress\r\nsite, and then the maintence of the website was a responsibility.</p>\r\n    <Image src={Img08} fluid className=\"pg1Img\" />\r\n    </Col>\r\n    </Row>\r\n\r\n    </Container>\r\n\r\n    </>\r\n      /* End of JSX Fragment*/\r\n)"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
